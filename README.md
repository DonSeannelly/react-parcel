# React Parcel
Minimal boilerplate for getting a React app up and running.

## Development
Run `npm start` and visit localhost:1234 in your browser.

## Testing
Unit tests should be written in a `spec.ts` file. For instance, when testing HelloWorld.jsx the corresponding tests should be written in HelloWorld.spec.js and placed in the same directory.

Run all unit tests with `npm run test`

## Deployment
Build distributable static files to the `/dist` directory with `npm run build`
